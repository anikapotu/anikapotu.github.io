## About Me
My name is Anika (uh-nee-ka). I am a senior at University of California, Merced. I found my interest for Computer Science when I started creating mini-projects using block-based coding in middle school. I decided to major in Computer Science after I realized I truly enjoyed creating mini-projects in Python in high school and because I enjoy doing math.
